# Vending Machine

A repository for the C# assignment at Yrgo.

The assignment was to build a .NET console application, a "digital vending machine", in which the following features
were implemented:

- The user can buy different items.
- To buy items the user needs enough money.
- The user should be able to see:
    - What they have bought.
    - Goods available in the machine.
    - How much money they have.

In the project I took the opportunity to work with the user experience (within the constraints of the console window) by
formatting and color coding information that the user gets from the app.
